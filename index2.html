    <h2>About NewJeans</h2>
    <p>
        <p>NewJeans is a South Korean girl group formed by ADOR, a subsidiary of HYBE Corporation, known for producing global acts like BTS. The group debuted on July 22, 2022, with their self-titled extended play, *New Jeans*. Their name symbolizes timeless fashion, reflecting their desire to create music and styles that remain fresh and relevant over time. They quickly gained attention for their unique approach to K-pop, focusing on a more casual, nostalgic image that contrasts with the flashy concepts often seen in the industry.</p>
<br>
        <p>The group consists of five members: Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin, and Hyein, who represent a mix of cultures and backgrounds. Their music blends genres like R&B, pop, and retro sounds, appealing to a broad audience. They are praised for their catchy yet relatable songs, such as “Attention,” “Hype Boy,” and “OMG,” which gained viral popularity on social media platforms. Their laid-back, minimalist visuals and storytelling in music videos stand out in the competitive K-pop scene, earning them a strong fanbase both in South Korea and internationally.</p>
<br>
        <p>What sets NewJeans apart is their approach to authenticity and connecting with fans. They aim to represent a youthful and fun image without overcomplicating their performances or style. This has resonated with fans who find their music refreshing and easy to enjoy.
